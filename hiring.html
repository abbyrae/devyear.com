        <h6>About the Saxifrage School</h6>
        <p>The Saxifrage School is a small, start-up, non-profit higher education laboratory working to serve students by lowering costs, re-thinking the campus and reconciling theory with practice. We have grown rapidly from 1 class last year, to 9 this year, and now a full-time program. We are excited to bring on a fourth staff person who is interested in building the future of higher education.</p>


        <h6>Description</h6>
        <p>Help us launch the first year-long development program at the Saxifrage School. We are looking for a thoughtful, interdisciplinary web developer who can be the go-to resource for our learning community. We are not looking for a teacher as much as we are a librarian and mentor. Someone who is always learning and has a love for creative, open source development would fit well with our program. This position will begin three months prior to the start of Dev.Year to allow for sufficient transition and planning time.
        </p>
      

        <h6>Responsibilities</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Work daily with Dev.Year members. <strong>Help</strong> them with their projects and to identify learning resources.</li>
          <li>Help create the Dev.Year <strong>Fieldbook</strong>: A resource-rich guide for incoming members. Help students to hack on it and remix it over the course of the year.</li>
          <li>Foster interest and commitment from local web developers and <strong>ask</strong> them to join our learning community.</li>
          <li>Invite and <strong>schedule</strong> developers for weekly dinner-guest lectures, workshops, co-working times, etc. Post the weekly learning opportunity schedule for all members.</li>
          <li>Work with students and developers to <strong>assess</strong> the quality of the program throughout the year.</li>
          <li>Just <strong>hang out</strong> with the community. A lot of the role involves spending quality time with the members, going to feasts, and having great discussions about the purpose and beauty of our work.</li>
        <br><br>
        <h6>Hours and Location</h6>
        <p>All work will take place within the Saxifrage School's campus neighborhood: the Garfield-East Liberty-Larimer community of Pittsburgh, PA. The position is Full-Time. The first three months of the position have completely flexible hours. The nine months during the Dev.Year program will have around 25 hours of scheduled time during which the Facilitator should be present. Their remaining work can happen at their discretion.</p>
